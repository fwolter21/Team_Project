# Data Analysis and Visualization Tool Proposal

## 1. The Big Idea
**Main Idea:** I aim to develop a Python-based program for data analysis and visualization. This project is inspired by my future career in consulting, where data processing and analysis are crucial but often not well-understood. My goal is to learn about useful libraries and create a tool that can be used by my future team and others in similar fields.

**MVP (Minimum Viable Product):**
- Ability to import data from CSV and Excel files.
- Basic data processing and statistical analysis.
- Data visualization through charts and graphs.
- A simple GUI for user interaction.

**Stretch Goal:**
- Enhanced data cleaning capabilities.
- Integration with external APIs for data retrieval.
- Advanced data processing and statistical analysis features.

## 2. Learning Objectives
- Gain proficiency in Pandas and NumPy for data handling.
- Develop skills in data visualization using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
- Acquire experience in GUI development, particularly with Flask.

## 3. Implementation Plan
- **Initial Research:** Selection of libraries, frameworks, and potential APIs.
- **Data Handling:** Experimenting with Pandas and NumPy for data manipulation.
- **Visualization:** Exploring various libraries for effective data visualization.
- **GUI Development:** Developing a user interface using Flask.

## 4. Project Schedule (6 Weeks)
- **Weeks 1-2:** Requirements gathering, initial design, and setup.
- **Weeks 3-4:** Core development focusing on data processing and basic visualization.
- **Week 5:** GUI development and integration with the backend.
- **Week 6:** Testing, debugging, and applying final touches.

## 5. Collaboration Plan
- As a solo project, I will be managing all aspects of development, from backend to frontend.

## 6. Risks and Limitations
- **Data Complexity:** Efficient handling of large or complex datasets to ensure performance and accuracy.
- **User Interface:** Creating an intuitive and responsive GUI to accommodate various user needs and visualization options.
- **Integration:** Seamless integration of components like data processing, visualization, and the GUI.
- **Workload Management:** Effectively managing the full scope of the project as a solo developer.
- **API Integration:** Successfully connecting with external APIs for data retrieval, managing API limitations, and ensuring data consistency.

## 7. Additional Course Content
- Experience with Flask, as it will be used for the GUI development.
- Learnings from assignment two, particularly in working with different libraries.
- Understanding of data types and their applications in data analysis.
